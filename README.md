CompareMaps documentation
================

NAME
====

CompareMaps - It's an R script to compare two phylostratigraphic maps and visualize this comparison using heatmap.

SYNOPSIS
========

CompareMaps.R --map1 file --map2 file -o outdir

CompareMaps.R --map1 ./t/data/bsfull3.phmap\_names --map2 ./t/data/bscdhit3.phmap\_names -o ./t/data/

DESCRIPTION
===========

This R script takes as input two maps generated by PhyloStrat software. That means they have headers with phylogeny information + stratified genes in body of document. It uses data.table to calculate joins between all phylostrata of one map and all phylostrata of other map. After that it plots this grid onto a heatmap and it prints this plot into pdf and png files. It also writes map comparison into tsv and xlsx files.

``` r
load(file="./t/data/my_grid.Rdata")
my_heatmap(my_grid, Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, scale="row", col=rev(heat.colors(20)),
    main=paste("bsfull3", "(1)_vs_", "bscdhit3", "(2)_comparison", sep=""), xlab="bscdhit3", ylab="bsfull3")
```
